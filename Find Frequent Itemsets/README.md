## Find Frequent Itemsets

#### Description 

This project involves implementing the SON Algorithm using the Spark Framework in Python. The goal is to find frequent itemsets in two datasets: a simulated dataset and a real-world generated dataset. The project has two tasks:

[SON&Apriori_on_Small_Dataset.py](https://github.com/ireneli0823/Data-Mining/blob/master/Find%20Frequent%20Itemsets/SON%26Apriori_on_Small_Dataset.py) involves building two kinds of market-basket models and calculating the combinations of frequent businesses or users that are qualified as frequent given a support threshold.

[SON&Apriori_on_Big_Dataset.py](https://github.com/ireneli0823/Data-Mining/blob/master/Find%20Frequent%20Itemsets/SON%26Apriori_on_Big_Dataset.py) involves exploring the Ta Feng dataset to find frequent itemsets and using the SON Algorithm to process the dataset. The dataset needs to be preprocessed before running the algorithm. The output format for both tasks is the same, and the total execution time needs to be reported. Only standard Python libraries are allowed, and only Spark RDD can be used. 

#### Used Techniques
